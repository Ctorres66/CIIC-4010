Special Thanks to users wester-is-not-real, kristinnenegron1 and gabyxrum for your help in the first, second, and  third projects respectively. The first project consists of changes to a game of snake. The second, to a diner dash style game and the third is applying "mods" to a java version of Minecraft. To be honest, once i started uploading everything, things got pretty messy, so i decided to put here the links to the original repositories for each of the projects for you to check out instead.
